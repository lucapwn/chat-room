## About

The [Chat Room](https://github.com/lucapwn/chat-room) software is a CLI (Command Line Interface) system that allows communication between users through a server.

The system is still under development and other features will be included later.

## Support

The software is currently only available for the GNU/Linux operating system.

In the near future I will include support for the Windows operating system and macOS.

## Running

Compile the software via the Makefile:

~~~console
foo@bar:~$ make run
~~~

Run the server by entering a port:

~~~console
foo@bar:~$ ./server 80
~~~

And create as many clients as you want to talk to:

~~~console
foo@bar:~$ ./client 127.0.0.1 80
~~~

## Screenshot

The image below illustrates the software running and the server communicating with two clients.
